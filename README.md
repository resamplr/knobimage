# knobimage

This is a simple program that will convert an image sequence of separate PNG files into one long vertical strip.  This is useful in many audio programs that still rely on raster graphics.

It's a similar concept to Knobman's export, but since I use different tools, I needed to make something different.

Be warned, it's messy.
